    "- Search Feature: This feature intends to create a way to implement sorting, first we will have an interactive page that will contain all the crypto data displayed in the table, the user will then be able to search for a certain type of crypto, after the specific crypto is chosen, it will lead result in the last 10-20 transactions which are all pulled from the api, the size of transactions will be displayed from largest to smallest and vice versa, the user will then have the option to click what type of sort method to view the new data in heap sort , bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort...etc...This data will then be store as number of itrteration so we can analyze data complezity, which return the type it took for each sort in order."

    "- Sort: We will have a page that redirects the user when they click on a specfic crypto which will allow them to chose to sort the transactions of the current crypto, after they will be returned with the time it took for the sort to implement BIG O analysis. \n",
    "- How: We will create frontend by fetching the backend and using js, we will also implement liquid sytling to give our homepage a uniform look without an excess amount of css so we will not have tags body and head tags in md files for style."
